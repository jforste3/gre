## Province Description

Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, was colonised by Greeks from the later eighth century B. C., with Syracuse becoming the largest and most powerful Greek polis; in time most of the indigenous settlements of the interior also became profoundly Hellenized. The western tip of the island was settled by Phoenicians and later became an outpost of Carthaginian control. In the third century B. C. Sicily became embroiled in the First Punic War which resulted in Rome's acquisition of the island as its first overseas provincia in 241 B. C.; in 211 B. C. Sicily was above all famed for its agricultural fertility and its capacity to produce exceptional grain yields (wheat and barley), and to a lesser extent wine. By the time of the Roman Empire the principal flourishing cities were located on the coast, with much of the interior given over to scattered agricultural villages, villas and farms.

## Garden Description

There is a small semicircular basin (Farrar Type E) inserted in a secondary period in the north edge of the peristyle, facing the principal marble-paved reception or dining-room of the north wing (Fig. 10). The basin has marble wall-veneer and plain tessellation on its floor (Fig 11). This arrangement at Durrueli may have been influenced by North African fashion, where the demi-lune basin is especially common.
