## Dates

unspecified (still flourished in the 2nd century CE)

## Garden Description

Pausanias mentioned a small grove of trees in the sanctuary of Zeus Philios that was in close proximity to the agora in Megalopolis [(8.31.4-5)](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:8.31). The grove was enclosed within a boundary wall.  In the precinct were images of the goddesses Demeter and Kore.  This grove almost certainly had been in existence since pre-Roman times, but it still flourished in the 2nd century A.D. when Pausanias visited the site.
