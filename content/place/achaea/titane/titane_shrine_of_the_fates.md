## Garden Description

In the narrow road to Titane near Corinth was a grove of holm oaks and a shrine of the Fates which Pausanias visited in the 2nd century A.D. ([2.11.4](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.11)). According to Pausanias, the grove was said to be particularly old.  Part of the religious ritual at the site was the annual sacrifice of pregnant ewes on the open-air altar and the offering of a libation made of a mixture of milk, honey and flowers.
