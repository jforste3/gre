## Location Description

Founded by Tyrians from Phoenicia, Carthage became the capital of a powerful empire that came into conflict with the expanding power of Rome. In 146 BC Carthage was completely destroyed and re-founded as a Roman colony by Augustus who completed Cesar's initial project. Augustus expanded the new city and encouraged settlements of veterans and civilians. The kingdom of Numidia was transformed into a province and Carthage was raised to the rank of capital. The city not only became the major port through which the wealth of the province flowed to Rome but also became a cultural capital that introduced the African elite to the rest of the empire, making it one of the wealthiest and most cosmopolitan cities in the Mediterranean world.
Of the Roman period, the city plan is clearly recognizable. The plan takes as its central axis the summit of the acropolis of Byrsa that divided the city into four quarters of equal size except for the one situated to the northwest. The most remarkable monuments found in Carthage are the Baths of Antonius situated on the seashore at the foot of the hill of Borj Jedid and the villas that stretched along the Odeon's hill. From the Christian era, several basilicas were found. The necropolis that surrounded the city has also provided important information on the city.

## Garden Description

In this very damaged house, a portico on four sides (IV-VII) enclosed a court (VIII) (8 x 11.10 m), which was planted during the building's second phase dated at the fourth/early fifth century. The northeast and southwest porticos had four columns and the northwest and southeast had five columns.

A low wall was added in between the columns that enclosed the garden. A semi-circular basin attached to a rectangular one oriented northeast/southwest (IX) was placed at the northeast end of the garden. (Plan view, Fig. 1). The house dates from the III-V c.
