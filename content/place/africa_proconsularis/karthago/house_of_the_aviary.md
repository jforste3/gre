## Location Description

Founded by Tyrians from Phoenicia, Carthage became the capital of a powerful empire that came into conflict with the expanding power of Rome. In 146 BC Carthage was completely destroyed and re-founded as a Roman colony by Augustus who completed Cesar's initial project. Augustus expanded the new city and encouraged settlements of veterans and civilians. The kingdom of Numidia was transformed into a province and Carthage was raised to the rank of capital. The city not only became the major port through which the wealth of the province flowed to Rome but also became a cultural capital that introduced the African elite to the rest of the empire, making it one of the wealthiest and most cosmopolitan cities in the Mediterranean world.
Of the Roman period, the city plan is clearly recognizable. The plan takes as its central axis the summit of the acropolis of Byrsa that divided the city into four quarters of equal size except for the one situated to the northwest. The most remarkable monuments found in Carthage are the Baths of Antonius situated on the seashore at the foot of the hill of Borj Jedid and the villas that stretched along the Odeon's hill. From the Christian era, several basilicas were found. The necropolis that surrounded the city has also provided important information on the city.

## Garden Description

Located on a hill overlooking Carthage, the *house of the aviary* is divided into two parts: the unit centered on the peristyle in the west, and the ensemble with the reception room in the east (Plan view, Fig. 1).

In the center of the peristyle in the western part of the house was an octagonal area enclosed by a low wall 50 cm high. P. Gauckler, the original excavator, recognized the area as a *viridarium* (1). The Aviary mosaic covers the floor space between the portico and the octagonal garden (1). In the center of each corner of the mosaic was a deep cavity in which a tree was planted. There was a cistern beneath the peristyle. A *lararium* (7) with an aedicula bodes the northern portico of the peristyle garden.

In the eastern part of the house, a low wall with six semi-circular niches that alternated with five square-shaped niches faced the *oecus* bordered by a portico. On the wall was laid out a large pool with small niches bordered on each side by two planters (26,27). On a higher level of the pool and the planters were three small cascades decorated with parietal mosaics and paintings depicting hunting and fishing scenes. Water coming from the huge cistern complex on the top of the hill ran through the cascades and fell into the pool. This arrangement can be compared to theater decor where nature is displayed. Hence, the *oecus* bordered by a portico was facing a *frons scaenae* composed by a *pulpitum* behind which were lined up the pool and two planters that could be compared to a *proscaenium*. The house dates from the end of the IInd-IVth century.
