## Place Description

The city of Neapolis that bears a Greek name meaning the "new city", is located on the south coast of Cap Bon at 60 km from Carthage. The municipal history of the city is not well known. Scholars disagree as to the foundation date of the colony some think it became *colonia Iulia* with Cesar and others think that it was elevated to the rank of colony by Augustus.
