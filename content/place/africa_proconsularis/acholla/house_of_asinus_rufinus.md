## Location Description

The city of Acholla was established forty-five km north of Sfax, along the seashore of the coast of Bysacena. When the city took sides with Rome in the third Punic war, Acholla was rewarded with the status of a free city. Later, under Hadrian, the city became a municipum. Production of oil from the countryside, inner cities of Bararus and Thysdrus, and commerce by sea made Acholla, with its harbor, a prosperous town.  Two baths and a series of houses testify to the wealth of the inhabitants of Acholla by the opulence and the originality of their mosaic décor. The mosaic decor gives evidence to the presence of one of the first mosaic workshops in Africa.

## Garden Description

The house of *Asinius Rufinus* (Approx.
835 m²) is located in the center of the city.  Towards the south its façade extends along an open area partially excavated and is interpreted as the possible forum of the city.  The house contains a mosaic pavement of Hercules and an inscription located in the main entrance hall with the honorific cursus of M. *Asinius Rufinus*, who was consul between 184 and 185. *Rufinus* most likely changed the older house (from Tiberian times) to this new one opened towards the South.  Therefore the data attributed to this phase of the house comes from the second half of the II century AD, during the reign of Commodus.

The house's incomplete excavation (Plan view, Fig. 1) includes a small entrance and several shops opening onto a non-excavated street oriented towards the North.  The various rooms of the house were laid out around a complete peristyle: the *triclinium* and two apartments in the south, an apartment on the east, two unpaved spaces on the north and a *lararium* (XIX) on the northwest.  A staircase indicates that the house had an upper level.

The low wall of four porticos spanned the *viridarium* of the peristyle (13.65 x 10.70 m), which curves to form an apse in front of the *triclinium* (IV) located on the south.  In the *viridarium* there was a cistern.  Access to the *viridarium* and cistern was provided under the north portico, between the 6th and 7th column.  If the low wall had been stuccoed and painted as the columns were, there are currently no traces of painting on the *viridarium* side of it.  Mortar channels along the north and the west of the garden collected the water from the roof and brought it to one of the cisterns located in the southwest corner of the garden.  The soil of the garden has not been examined.

Adjacent to the east apartment is a light well with an earthen floor, which can be regarded as a small garden (IX).  A large window in room VIII opened into this garden (IX).
