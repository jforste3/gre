## Dates

2nd-3rd century CE

## Garden Description

This richly decorated house is located to the east of the forum. A portico on four sides enclosed a court (ca 6.6x11.5m) that may have been planted in the early period of the house (Plan view, Fig.1). An *oecus-triclinium* with the famous fish mosaics opened off the north side of the portico. A large rectangular basin (4.67x2.93 m) oriented northeast-southwest was placed on the axis of the *triclinium*, which opened on the north side of the portico. A semicircular basin was attached to the large basin on the side facing the *triclinium*, but the two basins do not appear to be connected. Both basins were built above ground. The base of the large basin was found *in situ*; the sides consisted of six monolithic pillars (5 of which were found), into which were fitted six limestone plaques (only one was found) 1.63m high, and carved with trellis designs.
