## Location

## Location Description

The city of Mactaris that had belonged to the kingdom of the Massylii was elevated to the rank of colony under Marcus Aurelius. The city was located on an important road between the steppes of the south and the rich plains of the north. The site occupies a plateau, which rises nine hundred meters above the valley of the Wadi Saboun in the central massif of the High Tell.

Archaeological investigations brought to light the amphitheater, two forums, the temple of *Liber Pater*, on which was erected a Christian church, and the Neo-Punic sanctuary converted into a Christian building. Also found were the temples of Apollo and Diana, several public baths that have not been completely excavated among them the great baths to the southeast and their *palestra*, and the northern baths. Along the periphery of the site a pyramidal mausoleum and the mausoleum of the *Julii* were discovered, both built on a grand scale.

## Garden Description

This richly decorated house is located to the east of the forum. A portico on four sides enclosed a court (ca 6.6x11.5m) that may have been planted in the early period of the house (Plan view, Fig.1). An *oecus-triclinium* with the famous fish mosaics opened off the north side of the portico. A large rectangular basin (4.67x2.93 m) oriented northeast-southwest was placed on the axis of the *triclinium*, which opened on the north side of the portico. A semicircular basin was attached to the large basin on the side facing the *triclinium*, but the two basins do not appear to be connected. Both basins were built above ground. The base of the large basin was found *in situ*; the sides consisted of six monolithic pillars (5 of which were found), into which were fitted six limestone plaques (only one was found) 1.63m high, and carved with trellis designs.
