## Location

- [Althiburos (Médeïna)]({{<relref ".">}})
- {{< id vocab="Pleiades" id="324664" name="Althiburos" >}}

## Location Description

This town is located on the road between Carthage and Theveste near the border of Proconsularis and Byzacena 35 km west of Mactar. Under the Roman Empire it remained an indigenous civitas until it was raised to the status of a municipium by Hadrian: municipium aelium hadrianum augustum althiburitanum and later was granted the ius Italicum.

The trade of agricultural products and craftsmanship made Althiburos a prosperous city, particularly, the fabrication and the commerce of aromatics. The development of the city reached its peak under the Antonian and Severian dynasties. It is difficult to follow the history of Althiburos during the third century when the province of Africa underwent the severe crisis of 238. The city was abandoned just before the Arab conquest.  Excavations have brought to light the forum, the capitol, the Hadrianic triumphal arch and two temples. At the east corner of the forum, near one of the temples, was a complex of houses and a building with a rotonda to the south of which stood a monumental fountain. Outside the excavated center are other monuments, among them the theater and a triumphal arch.

## Garden Description

The house, noteworthy for its many and varied mosaic floors, is located on the right side of Oum El Abid river in a residential neighborhood. This vast *domus* is laid out around a peristyle onto which the rooms open. The courtyard (6.50 x 6.50 m) may have been planted (Plan view, Fig. 1).  A long basin(*euripus*; 4.15 x 1.85; D. 0,72m.) was placed on the axis of the *triclinium* (G). Each end of the basin is curved to form a semi-circular pool.

The *triclinium* was bordered on two sides by two apartments that each had rooms and a corridor. The rooms to the north of the *triclinium* have an additional non-paved courtyard (L) enclosed by a colonnade closed by a balustrade. This lightwell may have been a small garden.
