## Location

- [Hippo Regius]({{<relref ".">}})
- {{< id vocab="Pleiades" id="305090" name="Hippo Regius" >}}

## Location Description

The city of Hippo Regius overlooks a sheltered bay where, from earliest times, ships could moor. An independent city under the reign of the king Micipsa, the city was involved in the turmoil of the Roman civil wars, with the defeat and the suicide of Metellus Scipio and his ally Juba I. Under Augustus, the city became a *municipium*, and later a colony under Trajan. The wealthy port was also the residence of the imperial procurator in charge of supplying Rome with wheat. During the fourth century Saint Augustine was the bishop of the city.

Excavations have brought to light the theater, considered to be the largest in Africa, built against the St. Augustine hill; also parts of the forum, a public fountain, the market, the northern and southern baths, the so called Christian district with its basilica and so called villas' district.

## Garden Description

The upper level of this large house (after 330, according to stratigraphic dating) resulted from the joining of three dwellings and was built over two earlier levels, the courtyards or peristyles of which are still unknown. Like a maritime villa, the house had a long loggia, which extended and opened to the sea, towards the northeast. It was excavated first in 1911, then in 1951-52, in 1964 and more recently in 2002 (Plan view, Fig. 1, 2).

The peristyle garden of the house (ca 16.50 x 8.50 m) was enclosed on four sides by a portico supported by twenty marble columns; there was a first floor, as stairs have been found. A large *oecus* (B3) on the northeast side looked out on the garden. In front of this exedra was a shallow pool, framed by two columns. Behind the pool was a cistern opening covered with a stone slab; on the right and left, two square planters were added at a later period. In that part of the garden, the mosaic pavements of the lower level extended under the garden. On the opposite side, a beautiful semi-circular basin, framed by two fluted columns (now broken), and faced inside with colored marbles, was visible from the entrance of the house (Fig. 2). Between the large door and this basin, the portico was paved with white marble slabs. The open space certainly was a garden (B16) as it was planted with bushes a few years ago.
