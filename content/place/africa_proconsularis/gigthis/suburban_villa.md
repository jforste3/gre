## Garden Description

On the other side of the fortified enceinte, one hundred and fifty kilometers south was a large building that belonged to an architect according to an inscription found near the peristyle.

This huge suburban villa incompletely excavated, was laid out around two peristyles (Plan view, Fig. 1).

A large peristyle of twenty columns onto which rooms opened may have had a garden.

On the south of the peristyle was another courtyard with a portico of three columns on the east and west sides. The courtyard may have been planted.
