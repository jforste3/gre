## Location Description

The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to a *municipium* by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during the rein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.

## Garden Description

The market located to the SW of the forum had a peristyle that enclosed an open space that may have been planted. With no evidence, Merlin suggested that the courtyard was paved with white mosaics but scholars do not agree.  A large shade tree grows there today.
