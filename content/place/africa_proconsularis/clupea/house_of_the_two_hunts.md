## Dates

2nd-3rd, 5th-6th century CE

## Garden Description

<!-- Maison aux deux chasses -->

Known for its beautiful hunting scene mosaics, this large *domus* (1100m²) was laid out around a square shaped peristyle-garden (15.50x15m) (Plan view, Fig. 1). The low wall of four porticos enclosed the *viridarium*, which curves to form an apse in front of the *oecus*. The house was constructed on the remains of an old salt factory; the three basins located on the east side of the garden are the remains of the previous phase of the building.

The house is dated to the 5th-6th century AD on the base of the style of its mosaics, however stratigraphical and archaeological evidence shows previous building phases and supplies a *terminus post quem* to the second half of the 2nd century - first half of the 3rd century.
