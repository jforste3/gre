## Dates

2nd-4th, 5th century CE

## Garden Description

This large house (850 to 900m²) was built on the sea front and was laid out around a peristyle garden. The eastern part of the *domus* was destroyed by the sea; the western portico is complete, only a part of the north and south porticoes of the peristyle have survived. The peristyle was approximately 200 m² and its porticoes were separated from the garden by a low wall to which a basin was later added.

The house has known some modifications, one of which was the construction of a private bath that may have had a peristyle garden. The house was occupied between the second and the fourth centuries.

When the house was transformed into a church, during the middle of the IVth century, the garden of the peristyle may have been maintained.
