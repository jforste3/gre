## Garden Description

At the rear of this house excavated in 1899 was a courtyard garden (a) with a *portico* on the south. This was supported by one column that was reinforced by a large pillar. The garden was enclosed by a low wall with an opening on the south. A gutter that encircled the edges had a settling basin (0.35 x 0.45 m.; 0.55 m. deep) in the southwest corner. There was no cistern, but a *puteal* stood in the southeast corner.
