## Garden Description

The remains of this [*domus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus), on the western part of the [Palatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_Hill), are now under the Renaissance [Farnese gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnese_Gardens). The [*Domus Tiberiana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Tiberiana) is first mentioned after the death of [Nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero): [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) and [Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus) refer to it in the context of the turbulent events of 69 CE ([ Plut. *Galba*, 24.4](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg065.perseus-grc1:24.4); [Tac. *Hist*. 1.27](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi004.perseus-lat1:1.27); [Suet. *Vit*. 15.3](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo019.perseus-lat1:15.3) | [Trans.](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo019.perseus-eng1:15); [Suet. *Otho* 6.2](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo018.perseus-lat1:6)). It was an imperial residence for later emperors, including [Antoninus Pius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius), [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius), and [Lucius Verus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus) ([*Hist. Aug. Pius* 10.4](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Antoninus_Pius*.html) | [Trans.](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/historia_augusta/antoninus_pius*.html); [*Hist.

Aug. Ver*.2.4, 6.3-4](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Lucius_Verus*.html) | [Trans.](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Lucius_Verus*.html); [*Cass. Dio* 72.35.4](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0385.tlg001.perseus-grc1:72.35.4) | [Trans.](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html)), although Nero and [Domitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian) appear to have made the most changes to the original design.

For Francesco I, Duke of Parma, F. Bianchini made the first recorded systematic excavations, from 1720 to 1729.  Later excavations were carried out in the late nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century, with the most recent completed in the 1980s. Because of the Farnese gardens, however, the ancient substructures of the *domus* have not been fully explored.

The plan of the original *domus* is unknown, so that the earliest possible archaeologically recorded garden is during the time of [Caligula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula), who extended the *domus* beyond the [*Clivus Victoriae*](https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/clivus-victoriae) to the [*Forum Romanum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum), making the [*Atrium Vestae*](https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/atrium-vestae) and the [Temple of Castor](https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/castor-aedes-forum) the main entrance to the Palatine. Behind the Temple of Castor, these additions included a [peristyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristyle) and a [pool](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008692) (9 x 26 m.), suggesting the presence of a garden (Richardson, 137; Platner-Ashby; 191). [Suetonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius), relating the death of Caligula, refers to a [*diaeta*](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/diaeta-e316370?s.num=11), probably a [pavilion](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006819) within a garden, to which a [solarium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004179), perhaps a [terrace](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004182) covered by an [awning](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300254200), was connected.

Two inscriptions of the 1st century CE mention two imperial slaves *ex Hermaeo* ([CIL VI, 8663; 9949](https://cil.bbaw.de/hauptnavigation/das-cil/baende)) in the *Domus Tiberiana* and the name "*Hermaeum*" given to this *diaeta* suggest the use of [herms](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047170) as [sculptures](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600), perhaps along avenues and lawns, as known in other gardens (Fig. 3). Gardens are also assumed from inscriptions mentioning garden workers: a *praepositus velariorum*, that is the person who was responsible for the awnings of the solaria ([CIL VI, 8649](https://cil.bbaw.de/hauptnavigation/das-cil/baende)), a *topiarius* who tended the garden plants into fantastic shapes, ([CIL VI, 8649](https://cil.bbaw.de/hauptnavigation/das-cil/baende)) and a *vilicus domus Tiberianae* who oversaw the managing of the estate ([CIL VI, 8655](https://cil.bbaw.de/hauptnavigation/das-cil/baende)).

During the Swiss excavations of the 1980s, Clemens Krause identified 29 sectors in the *Domus Tiberiana*; 1-9 sectors were the nucleus of the complex and assumed for the "[*piano nobile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_nobile)" of the *Domus Tiberiana,* a well-constructed  arrangement of dwelling units and gardens (Krause, 193).

Such reconstruction was later changed on the basis of the results of surveys, beginning in the first years of the present century, carried out on large sectors of the *Horti Farnesiani* and then extended to the underlying [*cryptoportici*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptoporticus), which had very serious static problems. In fact the excavations brought to light, on what was in ancient times the  "*piano nobile*" of the *Domus Tiberiana*, a large green peristyle; at the center was a large [basins (vessels)](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300045614), with an internal profile made of alternating rectangular and semicircular [niches](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704) and equipped with plays of water (Fig. 4). Only the northern part of the basin was preserved; this preserved section was covered by [marble](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011443) slabs, as shown by the extant marks. The basin, later restructured by the Flavii when the *Domus Tiberiana* was incorporated into the [Palace of Domitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Domitian), is dated to the Julio-Claudian era, and is certainly related to a [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) pipe carrying water to it, which bears the inscription TI CLAVDI CAES AVG, referring to the emperor [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius) ( CIL XV, 7269 a-b).

During the second building phase (II, 2) of the [*Domus Aurea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Aurea), it was incorporated into the *Domus Tiberiana* (Krause, 193). A large platform (400 x 450 Roman feet), which included the addition of a perimeter wall as well as a system of waterproofing and drainage in sector 9, was added. A small *cryptoporticus* under a peristyle (100 x 150 Roman feet) was located in the center. On this platform Nero constructed buildings (Carandini, 13), and it appears that [hanging gardens](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008100) (*nemora pensile*), probably enclosed by a *quadriporticus*, surrounded it.  At the southeast corner of the platform, according to Krause (Lexicon, 193), was an oval "*vivaio*;" a place for raising fish in an area that here remained open to the sky.

During the Flavian era, the garden was covered by new constructions in sectors 1, 3, 4 and 9 (Krause, 1990, 124). It was at this time gardens in sectors 7, 10, 11, and perhaps 12 were modified (Krause, 1990, 124).
